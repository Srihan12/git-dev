Step1: Launch an instance and connect it to the terminal.
Step2: Install ansible in the terminal.
yum install ansible-core -y
Step3: Configure ansible and change the inventory path.
vim /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg
inventory = /etc/ansible/hosts
Step4: Launch a remote_server instance and connect it to the terminal
Step5: Copy the private ip of remote_server and add in the hosts file of ansible.
In ansible_server
vim /etc/ansible/hosts
(paste the private ip of remote_server)
Step6: Generate an ssh key, copy the public key and paste it in the authorized keys of remote_server.
In ansible_server
 
ssh-keygen
cd .ssh/
cat id_rsa.pub
(copy the public key)
In remote_server
 
cd .ssh/
vim authorized_keys
(Paste the key)
Step7: Write a Playbook in ansible to install,start and enable httpd package and also to copy the fstab file to tmp folder of remote_server.
vim playbook.yml
---
- name: Install and configure HTTPD
  hosts: private ip of remote_server # Replace with your server's hostname or IP
  become: true  # Execute tasks with sudo privileges
  tasks:
    - name: Install httpd package
      package:
        name: httpd
        state: present  # Ensure the package is installed
    - name: Start httpd service
      service:
        name: httpd
        state: started  # Ensure the service is started
        enabled: true   # Enable the service to start on boot
    - name: Copy fstab file to /tmp
      copy:
        src: /etc/fstab  # Source file path on the control machine
        dest: /tmp/fstab  # Destination file path on the remote server

Step8: Run the playbook.
ansible-playbook playbook.yml
Step9: Ckeck the status of httpd in remote_server
rpmquery httpd
systemctl status httpd
